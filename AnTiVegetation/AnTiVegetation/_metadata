Right now it does not add \"new\" plants, but adds additioral frames and alternatives to existing plants:\n\n[u]Farmables:[/u]\nHalf of the farmables will now have 2 additional frames for each growth stage 0 and 1. So they don't look all the same anymore, when planted.\nFarmables variations appear on old worlds too.\n\n[u]Vines:[/u]\nExtened parts for vanilla vines: 4 instead of 2 Bases, 8 instead of 2 Middle parts (2 new stems + alternative foliage for each of the 4 stems), 3 instead of 2 End parts. For almost all vines, except some special ones.\nNew:  3 new foliage for default forest vines, 1 new for Mushroom stalks.\nVines parts only appear on [b]NEW[/b] planets!\n\n[u]Grass:[/u]\n19 new Grass types for different planets/biomes.\nGrass needs a [b]NEW[/b] planet to show up.\n\n[h1]Compatibility[/h1]\nFarmable appearance gets OVERWRITTEN. Farmable stats are not affected.\nVines are more modular and new stuff is appended to vanilla vines.\nNew Foliage for vines gets added to foliage list in Biomes, could conflict with mods that change the Vanilla spawn item order...\n\n[h1]Shameless advertisement[/h1]\n[b]GET MY OTHER MODS TOO!!![/b]\n- [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=730544933]AnTiHair adds 239 new hair styles[/url]\n- [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=730745660]AnTiMonster adds 117 monster parts[/url]",
